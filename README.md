# lua-resty-scrypt

`lua-resty-scrypt` is a scrypt (password) hashing library for OpenResty.

## Hello World with lua-resty-scrypt

```lua
local scrypt = require "resty.scrypt"
local hash   = scrypt.crypt "My Secret"         -- returns a hash that can be stored in db
local valid  = scrypt.check("My Secret", hash)  -- valid holds true
local valid  = scrypt.check("My Guess",  hash)  -- valid holds false

local n,r,p  = scrypt.calibrate()               -- returns n,r,p calibration values
```

## Installation

Just place [`scrypt.lua`](https://github.com/bungle/lua-resty-scrypt/blob/master/lib/resty/scrypt.lua) somewhere in your `package.path`, preferably under `resty` directory. If you are using OpenResty, the default location would be `/usr/local/openresty/lualib/resty`.

### Compiling and Installing Scrypt C-library

These are just rudimentary notes. Better installation instructions will follow:

1. First download Scrypt from here: https://github.com/bungle/lua-scrypt
2. Run `make`
4. Place `scrypt.so` in Lua's `package.cpath` (or modify `scrypt.lua` and point `ffi_load("scrypt")` with full path to `scrypt.so`, e.g. `local json = ffi_load("/usr/local/lib/lua/5.1/scrypt.so")`).

### Using LuaRocks or MoonRocks

If you are using LuaRocks >= 2.2:

```Shell
$ luarocks install lua-resty-scrypt
```

If you are using LuaRocks < 2.2:

```Shell
$ luarocks install --server=http://rocks.moonscript.org moonrocks
$ moonrocks install lua-resty-scrypt
```

MoonRocks repository for `lua-resty-scrypt`  is located here: https://rocks.moonscript.org/modules/bungle/lua-resty-scrypt.

## Lua API

#### string scrypt.crypt(opts)

Uses scrypt algorithm to generate hash from the input. Input parameter `opts` can
either be `string` (a `secret`) or a table. If it is a table you may pass in some
configuration parameters as well. Available table options (defaults are as follows):

```lua
local opts = {
    secret   = "",
    keysize  = 32,
    n        = 32768
    r        = 8,
    p        = 1,
    salt     = "random (saltsize) bytes generated with OpenSSL",
    saltsize = 8
}
```

If you pass opts anything other than a table, it will be `tostring`ified and used
as a `secret`. `keysize` can be between 16 and 512, `saltsize` can be between 8
and 32.

This function returns string that looks like this:

```lua
n$r$p$salt$hash
```

All parts present a `hex dump` of their values.

##### Example

```lua
local h1 = scrypt.crypt "My Secret"
local h2 = scrypt.crypt{
    secret  = "My Secret",
    keysize = 512 
}
```

#### boolean scrypt.check(secret, hash)

With this function you can check if the `secret` really matches with the `hash` that
was generated with `scrypt.crypt` from the same `secret`. The `hash` contains also the
configuration parameters like `n`, `r`, `p` and `salt`.

##### Example

```lua
local b1 = scrypt.check("My Secret", scrypt.crypt "My Secret") -- returns true
local b2 = scrypt.check("My Secret", scrypt.crypt "No Secret") -- returns false
```

#### n, r, p scrypt.calibrate(maxmem, maxmemfrac, maxtime)

This function can be used to count `n`, `r`, and `p` configuration values from
`maxmem`, `maxmemfrac` and `maxtime` parameters. These are the defaults for those:

```lua
maxmem     = 1048576
maxmemfrac = 0.5
maxtime    = 0.2
```

The results may change depending on your computer's processing power.

##### Example

```lua
local n,r,p = scrypt.calibrate()
local hash  = scrypt.crypt{
    secret  = "My Secret",
    n = n,
    r = r,
    p = p
}
```

#### number scrypt.memoryuse(n, r, p)

Counts the memory use of scrypt-algorigth with the provided `n`, `r`, and `p`
arguments.

##### Example

```lua
local memoryuse = scrypt.memoryuse(scrypt.calibrate())
```

Default parameters for `n`, `r`, and `p` are:

```lua
n = 32768
r = 8
p = 1
```
